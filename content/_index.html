<h1>What are Special Interest Groups (SIGs)?</h1>
<p>A Special Interest Group (SIG) is a community within ISOP with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning or technology, where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within their particular field. The SIGs communicate, meet, develop training materials, develop position papers and publications, support students, and organize programming ideas.</p>
<p>There are four ISoP special interest groups.</p>
<p>Clinical Pharmacometrics SIG
Mathematical and Computational Sciences (MCS) SIG
Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) SIG
Statistics and Pharmacometrics (SxP) SIG</p>
